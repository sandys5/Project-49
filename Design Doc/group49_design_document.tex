Next Summer, the Summer of 2019, will be the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing and our group, `The Apolloers', is working to create a 3D animation of the mission. This animation is being made for Jim Todd at OMSI so that we can display the animation in the museum as part of their 50th anniversary exhibit. This document will show how we have organized the project and offer different design viewpoints so that stakeholders can see how the project has been structured.

\section{Overview}
       \subsection{Scope}
        This document focuses on the 3D animation for the Apollo 11 Mission that will be created by our group, "The Apolloers" for display at OMSI. The design principals of the project will be outlined here, as well as design elements, such as functionality, usability, requirements, and more. %MORE HERE
        
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The design and structure of this project will be outlined so that readers would be able to understand how the 3D animation is organized from a development viewpoint. In addition to the readers, this document will also serve as guidelines for our group to follow throughout the year. This document will be changed throughout the year as we refine our design. 

    \subsection{Intended Audience}
        This document is intended for the stakeholders of this Apollo 11 3D animation, as well as any interested group that would like to know more about how the animation is structured. Some main takeaways of this document are the design, structure, and connectivity of the components of our animation, so that readers would have a general idea of how to make a similarly structured project.

\section{Design Description}

    \subsection{Design Stakeholders}
    The stakeholders for our project are OMSI as well as the audiences who will be viewing our video. The educational and technical quality of our video will reflect on OMSI. Our group will also be using a storyboard created by some of OMSI's staff to base the video's narrative off of, so OMSI will also have influence over how this video is created. The planetarium audiences will also be affected by the technical and educational quality of our video. If the video is more entertaining than educational, then the audience will not understand the impact and ambition of the Apollo 11 mission. If the video is more educational than entertaining, then the audience will be bored and less likely to pay attention to the content of the video.
    \subsection{Design Views}
    %Is our view the whole project?
    
    \subsection{Design Viewpoints}
    The Apollo 11 animation project can be broken into different viewpoints that can all be used to describe the animation. We have broken the project into the following: Context, Composition, Logical, Dependency, Information, Interface, Interaction, and Resources viewpoints. Each of these viewpoints aim to provide an answer to various questions proposed by the project such as: what will the animation consist of, how will data be stored and used, how will users interact with the project, etc. 
    
    \subsection{Design Elements}
    There are many elements of a 3D animation that all need to work with the other elements to produce a quality project. Programming platforms such as OpenAL and OpenGL will be used for managing the other elements relating to 3D graphics and audio respectively. OpenAL will be used to work with audio files from the transmissions from the mission, as well as various sound effects that will be included to immerse the audience. 
    
    The programming in OpenGL will dictate what 3D objects are in the project, where they are in the scene, and how they look. Many 3D objects in our project will come from an online repository, which we may need to add textures to, which would also be found online. Once the 3D object is in the scene, different lighting features will be programmed in to account for the Sun and that light reflecting off of the other objects. Animating the objects will require use of real physics and orbital mechanics applied to the objects to provide realistic movement.

\section{Design Viewpoints}

    \subsection{Context Viewpoint}
    %This will be an OMSI presentation, viewers would be visitors, etc.
    %careful about overlap with Interface viewpoint
    
    This animation will be viewed primarily by OMSI visitors. This audience can range from young school children on field trips, to very technical industry leaders. We will want the user of this program to be able to change the viewpoint of the scene, regardless of if the user is a visitor or a staff member running the program.  
    
    \subsection{Composition Viewpoint}
    %How the project is split into different parts (Audio, modeling, textures, objects, etc.)
    
    Our project will consist of eleven main scenes of the Apollo 11 mission: launch, to orbit, to trans-lunar injection, to moon, to lunar orbit, to landing, to re-launch, to lunar orbit, to trans-Earth injection, to Earth, to splashdown. Then, within each of these scenes, there will be many different parts that make the scene: 3D objects, animation, audio, textures, lighting, orbital mechanics acting on objects, and possibly captioning for the audience. While there are not direct relationships between all these parts, they all add to the overall detail and quality of the animation. 
    
    \subsection{Logical Viewpoint}

    Most of our logic will be based on how far along the mission we are in the animation. We will have a flight path and as we make progress along that path, different actions will happen at different points, such as turning rockets on/off, dropping booster rockets, starting to land, etc. 
    %What is the flight path? An array of vertices? A function?
    
    \subsection{Dependency Viewpoint}

    Some texturing will need to change depending on where the viewpoint is. A main example is that we don't want to use incredibly detailed textures for the Moon when the rocket has barely left Earth, and vice versa. We can have the textures change depending on distance, but this change should not be noticeable to the viewer.
    
    Our audio triggers will be dependant on what point in the mission we are at, such as audio at launch, leaving the atmosphere, landing on the moon, etc. 
    
    \subsection{Information Viewpoint}
    %The physics, math, numbers, etc.
    For our project, the information we will need includes the flight path of the Apollo 11 as well as orbital mechanics for the Apollo 11 and solar system. The moon and Apollo 11 will follow orbital mechanics because it is integral to the flight path of the Apollo 11. Our group needs to accurately recreate the flight path in order to make our video as realistic as possible. If the flight path were incorrect, audience members would be wrongly informed about the Apollo 11 mission.

    \subsection{Interface Viewpoint}
       
       The 3D animation will be compiled into an executable file (.exe) so that the user can open the whole animation from one file. Then, the user will be able to start and stop the animation using a keyboard, and change their viewpoint by clicking and dragging their mouse, or choose set viewpoints using the keyboard. If the user does not want to change the viewpoint, the viewpoint will be set to default viewing positions that our group has chosen. The user will be able to view the video from outside of the spacecraft, inside the spacecraft, on the moon, and on Earth. As the animation progresses, there will be functionality for the user to step back or forward through the animation, and possibly jump to pre-defined points in the flight path.

        
    \subsection{Interaction Viewpoint}
    %Is this section actually applicable? Our entities dont really interact...
    
    \subsection{Resources Viewpoint}
    To obtain the audio of the transmissions between the Apollo 11 crew and Tranquility Base, we will use NASA's archive of audio files from the Apollo 11 mission. Using OpenAL, these files will be played approximately at the same stage of the mission as they were recorded in. Our group will not be implementing every audio file in the Apollo 11 audio archive. We will be including audio files that are entertaining and not filled with jargon, so the audience can understand and enjoy the conversations between Tranquility Base and the Apollo 11.
    
    To obtain the audio for the sound effects in our project, our group will download audio files from free online sound effects libraries. We will only need two audio files for sound effects, one for the splash of the splashdown and another for the roar of the Saturn 5 rockets. Like the audio files obtained from NASA's archive, the audio will be implemented in a 3D space using OpenAL. 
    % where are we getting 3-D objects, audio files, etc.
