The folder "Project Executable" holds an executable file for our project for the code freeze. 
To run this program, download the folder (or the whole repo) and launch the executable from within the folder so that it has access to all dependable files. 
If you would like, you can open the Apollo11.sln in Visual Studio and build the solution there, using the Win32 platform.
Note that this project has only been designed for use on a Windows operating system and has not been tested on other platforms. 
Also, expect 1-2 minutes to load the program.
